Has your application ever run out of memory when running a query that returns a
a significant amount of data?

For example, in PHP, I have seen a script like the following die because it ate
up too much memory on my application server.

```php
$sql = <<<SQL
SELECT *
FROM really_large_table
SQL;

$res = pg_query($sql);
while ($row = pg_fetch_row($res)) {
  // Process $row...
}
```

So how can you reduce your application's memory usage when querying a large
amount of data from Postgres?

Well, your application is running out of memory because you are trying to query
all of the data at once, and your application server cannot (or will not) hold
that many results in memoryâ€”this is to be expected.

Imagine you and I are packing up all of the books at my house and you, while
holding an empty box, said, "Hey, let's pack up the books, put them all in
here," and I continued by putting 150 books in your box. You would eventually
drop the box because it would become too heavy.

Instead, you would probably say, "Hey, let's pack up the books. Can you give me
5 at a time?" Once you had about 15 in there, you could get another box,
then ask for five more, until we had packed all of the boxes.

So instead of asking for all of the books at once, you would ask for the books a
few at a time, or in **chunks**.

Querying your data in a memory efficient way from Postgres works similarly.
Instead of asking for all of the data at once, we can request the data back from
Postgres in **chunks** via a `CURSOR`. Take a look at the following example to
see how you can use cursors.

```sql
-- Cursors can only be declared within a transaction
BEGIN;

-- Initialize the cursor, passing the query you want to run
DECLARE my_cursor NO SCROLL CURSOR FOR (
  SELECT *
  FROM reall_large_table
);

-- Fetch the results, 100 at a time in this case
FETCH 100 FROM my_cursor;
FETCH 100 FROM my_cursor;

-- Clean up
CLOSE my_cursor;
```

Let's rewrite our initial example now that we know how cursors work.

```php
pg_query("BEGIN");

$sql = <<<SQL
SELECT *
FROM really_large_table
SQL;

pg_query("DECLARE my_cursor NO SCROLL CURSOR FOR ({$sql})");

do {
    $res = pg_query("FETCH 100 FROM my_cursor");
    while ($row = pg_fetch_row($res)) {
      // Process $row...
    }
} while (pg_num_rows($res) > 0);

pg_query("CLOSE my_cursor");

// Make sure you check for errors
```

This example does not throw an error, and only uses as much memory as it takes
to hold 100 rows of data.

You can read more about cursors in the PostgreSQL
[documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-declare.html).
