title: What do I listen to while coding?
tags: [Music, Coding]

I have spent as much time listening to music as I have writing code. People say
that you need to practice for 10,000 hours to be a professional, and since I
have spent well over 10,000 hours writing code, I think it makes sense to
consider myself a _professional music listener_.

I have one master playlist in
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/zacharyrankin/playlist/6t0hMZsbEk8nFvUZ2KLLLf?si=cicdRjjXQMiXhZhR6iM0wA)
that has a good variety of music. I listen to just about everything, though I
would say electronic music is the most prevalent in my playlist. The simple
beats seem to set a certain pace; however, this can get, and I find myself
looking for something different from day to day, so I look to classical or rock
or country.

Other devs have told me that songs with vocals distract them because they cannot
help but focus on what the musician is saying. Personally, I am not distracted
by it. I guess I have a unique talent for not hearing voicesâ€”just ask
my family. Music can be the background noise that helps me stay focused while
programming but there are times where it is more than that.

It might seem weird, but there are times where I will hear a song and remember
what I was feeling at the moment I was writing code and listening to that song.
I think it is refreshing to have moments like these since I think the general
mindset is that programming is void of emotion.

I could not imagine programming without my music. Here is my crazy playlist that
has a good variety of genres, a lot of fun, and is always growing. Please send
me an email if you like the playlist or if you think that my playlist is lacking
in some music essentials.
